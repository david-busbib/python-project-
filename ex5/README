This project is a Python implementation of a word search solver. The program reads a list of words and a matrix of
 letters, then finds and counts the occurrences of the words within the matrix in various directions.

**Features**
Word Reading: Reads words from a specified file.
Matrix Reading: Reads a matrix of letters from a specified file.
Directional Search: Searches for words in the matrix in multiple directions: right, left, up, down, and diagonals.
Results Output: Writes the search results to an output file.

**Files**
wordsearch.py: The main program file that contains all the functions for reading files, searching the matrix,
 and writing results.
How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Download wordsearch.py.
Prepare a word list file and a matrix file in the appropriate format.
Run the program using the following command:
bash
Copy code
python wordsearch.py <word_list_file> <matrix_file> <output_file> <search_directions>

**Functions Overview**
read_wordlist(filename): Reads words from the specified file.
read_matrix(filename): Reads a matrix of letters from the specified file.
reverse_matrix(matrix_lst): Reverses the rows of the matrix.
transpose_matrix(matrix_lst): Transposes the matrix.
up_right_diagonal(matrix_lst): Extracts diagonals from bottom-left to top-right.
down_right_diagonal(matrix_lst): Extracts diagonals from top-left to bottom-right.
search_words_and_count(words, matrix_lst, good_words_lst): Searches for words in the matrix and counts their occurrences.
update_dict(current_dict, final_dict): Updates the final dictionary with counts from the current dictionary.
dictionary_to_list(f_dict): Converts the dictionary to a list of tuples.
right_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the right direction.
left_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the left direction.
up_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the up direction.
down_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the down direction.
up_right_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the up-right diagonal direction.
down_left_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the down-left diagonal direction.
down_right_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the down-right diagonal direction.
up_left_search(matrix_lst, words): Searches for words in the up-left diagonal direction.
finale_directions(directions): Removes duplicate directions from the input string.
find_words(word_list, matrix, directions): Finds and counts words in the matrix based on the given directions.
write_output(results, filename): Writes the search results to the specified output file.
main(): Main function to run the program.

**Example Usage**
To find words in a matrix using the word list from words.txt and the matrix from matrix.txt, and output the results
 to output.txt while searching in all directions, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python wordsearch.py words.txt matrix.txt output.txt udrlwxyz
