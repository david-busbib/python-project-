# Image Processing Project

## Overview

This project contains scripts for various image processing tasks, including a cartoonify algorithm that transforms images into cartoon-like versions. The main scripts are `ex6_helper.py`, `test_ex6_2022B.py`, and `cartoonify.py`.

## Files Description

### ex6_helper.py
This script provides helper functions for handling images. It includes:
- `load_image`: Loads an image from a file.
- `show_image`: Displays an image.
- `save_image`: Saves an image to a file.
- Functions to convert between PIL Image objects and list representations.



### cartoonify.py
This script implements a cartoonify algorithm, using:
- Grayscale conversion.
- Edge detection.
- Image blurring.
- Color quantization.

The main function `cartoonify` takes an image and parameters for blurring, thresholding, and quantization to produce a cartoon-like effect.

## Usage

1. **Load an Image:**
   ```python
   from ex6_helper import load_image
   image = load_image('path_to_image.png')
2. Display an Image:
   ```python
   from ex6_helper import show_image
   show_image(image)
3. Save an Image:
   ```python
    from ex6_helper import save_image
    save_image(image, 'path_to_save_image.png')
4. Cartoonify an Image:
    ```python
    from cartoonify import cartoonify
    cartoon_image = cartoonify(image, blur=5, threshold=100, quantize=4)
    show_image(cartoon_image)
    save_image(cartoon_image, 'path_to_save_cartoon_image.png')
5. Run Tests:
    ```python
    python test_ex6_2022B.py
    ```
