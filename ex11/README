This project involves implementing a binary decision tree to work with diagnostic data, allowing for binary classification based on symptoms. This exercise helps build a strong understanding of binary tree structures and decision trees.

Project Structure
ex11.py: The main file for implementing the Decision Tree logic. It contains:
Node and Record classes for representing the tree nodes and individual health records.
Diagnoser class that manages the decision tree and provides various methods for diagnosis, success rate calculations, and tree optimization.
Classes and Methods
Node
Represents a node in the decision tree, holding data and references to child nodes.


Methods:
diagnose(symptoms): Diagnoses based on given symptoms by traversing the decision tree.
calculate_success_rate(records): Calculates the accuracy of the tree against known records.
all_illnesses(): Returns a list of illnesses in the tree, sorted by frequency.
paths_to_illness(illness): Finds all paths in the tree leading to a specified illness.
Additional Functions
build_tree(records, symptoms): Constructs a decision tree based on given records and symptoms, optimizing for matching symptoms to the correct diagnosis.
optimal_tree(records, symptoms, depth): Constructs an optimal tree that limits the treeâ€™s depth for better generalization.
minimize(remove_empty=False): Simplifies the tree by removing redundant nodes and balancing the structure.
Running the Code
Place your data file in the project directory.
Use Diagnoser methods to interact with the decision tree for diagnosis and tree manipulation.
